# Amazon Gpu Scraper

Scrapes urls given in the trackers csv file.

Will give price, title, review count, if in stock, and export it to an excel file.

Done as practice with beautifulsoup as GPU prices have been dropping, and have been curious to see how they drop over the coming months.

You can set a scheduled run of the script for it to run say once a day..etc.
